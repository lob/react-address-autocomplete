# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Local Development with @lob/react-address-autocomplete

The source code for @lob/react-address-autocomplete is stored at the parent level of this demo project. In order to use it instead of the version in npm run the following:
```
# At the parent level where @lob/react-address-autocomplete lives
npm link
# Go to demo project
cd example/
# Complete link to local copy
npm link @lob/react-address-autocomplete
```

Now when we import anything from @lob/react-address-autocomplete, npm will use the local copy of the package on our system. Please note that you must run `npm run build` to apply changes made to the local copy of @lob/react-address-autocomplete. `npm run start` will automatically rebuild any changes made to the repo for a smoother developer experience.

When you are done testing changes, use `npm unlink` in the reverse order.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
